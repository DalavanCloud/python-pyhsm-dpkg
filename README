This is the Python package to talk to YubiHSM's.

YubiHSM's are Yubico's take on an easy and affordable HSM.

See the files in examples/ to get an idea of how to use this code.

  Introduction
================

pyhsm aims to be a reference implementation implementing all the
functions available in the YubiHSM. The base version number of pyhsm
will match the supported hardware version of the YubiHSM (e.g. 0.9.8,
0.9.8a, 0.9.8b all intended to be used with hardware version 0.9.8).

pyhsm also includes the regression test suite for the YubiHSM.

In addition to the YubiHSM communication library, pyhsm also contains
some applications utilizing the YubiHSM :

  * yhsm-val    - a simple validation server supporting validation of
                  YubiKey OTP's, OATH codes and password hashes.
  * yubikey-ksm - ykval YubiKey OTP decryption backend using the
                  YubiHSM.

and some smaller examples in the examples/ directory, that might still
be directly useful though.

  * yhsm-sysinfo.py
		- Print basic system information about the connected
		  YubiHSM.
  * yhsm-linux-add-entropy.py
                - Feed Linux kernel with random entropy from the TRNG
		  on the YubiHSM.
  * yhsm-storage-unlock.py
		- Unlock the key storage in the YubiHSM with your HSM
		  password. Use with incorrect password to lock it again.
  * yhsm-monitor-exit.py
		- Get a YubiHSM *in debug mode* to enter configuration
		  mode again, without having to press the little button
		  while inserting it into the USB port.
  * yhsm-password-auth.py
		- Example of how to turn passwords (or hashes of
		  passwords if you like PBKDF2) into AEADs that can be
		  used to verify the password later on.

  Installation
================

pyhsm is known to work with Python 2.6 and 2.7.

It is primarily tested using Debian/Ubuntu, but is of course
meant to work on as many platforms as possible.

pyhsm is installable in the standard-python way :

  $ cd pyhsm-$ver
  $ python setup.py install

This requires the python-setuptools (well, the package is called
that in Debian/Ubuntu).

You will also need the pyserial package (python-serial in
Debian/Ubuntu) from http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/ and, to run
the test suite, pycrypto from http://www.pycrypto.org/
(python-crypto in Debian/Ubuntu).

I use Ubuntu, so I created a PPA (Personal Package Archive) for
easy installation (and removal) on Ubuntu systems.

If you use a recent Ubuntu release, you should be able to install
python-pyhsm with these commands :

  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fredrikt/yubico
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python-pyhsm

The Launchpad PPA key generated for my packages is C7E50642.

If you want to work on Debian/Ubuntu packaging, or just build packages
directly from version controlled sources, you can find it maintained
in a git repository.

  $ git clone git://github.com/Yubico/python-pyhsm-dpkg.git
  $ cd python-pyhsm-dpkg
  $ git-buildpackage

See https://github.com/Yubico/python-pyhsm-dpkg for more information.
