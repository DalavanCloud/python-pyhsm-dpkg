Python-pyhsm NEWS -- History of user-visible changes.          -*- outline -*-

* Version 1.0.4c (released 2013-03-18)

** When doing OTP verification, if a nonce is written to the AEAD file
use that for decryption, not public id.

** yhsm-import-keys: add --random-nonce for using hsm generated nonce.

** yhsm-generate-keys: add --random-nonce for using hsm generated nonce.

* Version 1.0.4b (released 2013-02-11)

** yhsm-import-keys: Support soft HSM AEAD generation.
** yhsm-import-keys: Ignore lines starting with #.
** yhsm-import-keys: Block all-zero (ccc...c) keys.

** yhsm-decrypt-keys: Support generating AEADs.
** yhsm-decrypt-keys: Ignores non-modhex files in AEAD directory trees.

** yhsm-generate-keys: Bugfix that caused AEAD generation to fail.
** yhsm-generate-keys: Bugfix that caused wrong nonce to be used.
** yhsm-generate-keys: Prevent generating all-zero (ccc...c) keys.

** Added this NEWS file, based on debian/changelog in the Debian package.

* Version 1.0.4a (released 2012-06-26)

** Enable IPv6 --addr for network servers.

** Verifies communication with YubiHSM on initialization.

* Version 1.0.4 (released 2012-06-21)

** Match firmware 1.0.4.
Firmware adds flag YSM_USER_NONCE to address security problem
for some usages where AEADs could be decrypted by an attacker
capable of generating new AEADs.

** New file format for stored AEADs (code loading AEADs is backwards
** compatible), including key handle and nonce.

** AES CCM implementation compatible with YubiHSM in software, for
** transparency and to enable willfull decryption of AEADs.

** Tools to generate YubiKey secrets into AEADs as well as decrypt
** them to enable provisioning YubiKeys with the secrets.

* Version 1.0.3c (released 2012-01-05)

** First public release.
